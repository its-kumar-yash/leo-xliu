- 🏫 I’m currently studying... </br>
      Computer Science at the University of California, Los Angeles! </br>
- ⏩ I'm most interested in... </br>
      finding the most efficient algorithms!
- ✨ I'm blown away...</br>
      by the idea that the fastest CPU paired with a bad algorithm is leagues worse than an average human with a good algorithm! </br>
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about...</br>
      the internal workings and nuances of the Linux Kernel!
- 💞️ I’m looking to...</br>
      progress my knowledge and experience in the field of computer science as a software engineering intern! </br>
- ⚡ In my free time I enjoy...</br>
      working out, going on long walks with my dog, playing video games, and building computers! </br>
